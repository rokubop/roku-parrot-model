# Roku Parrot Model

This is my parrot model + patterns + model history notes.

I don't recommend you use this, because a parrot model should be trained and specific to your own voice.

| Noises (14) | Typical use |
|---|---|
| ah | Left direction or left click drag |
| oh | Right direction or right click |
| guh | down direction or modifier for CTRL |
| eh | forward or up direction or eye tracker positioner |
| pop | click |
| cluck | Typically used to enable or disable parrot mode where all 14 noises do something. During game however, I use it as a normal action. |
